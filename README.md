If you are a DIRAC developer and want to appear on
[this map](../master/developers.geojson),
then find yourself on [Google Maps](https://maps.google.com/),
right-click, then on "What's here?", then you see the coordinates.
Send these to Radovan Bast (lastname at kth dot se).

Alternatively you can also add yourself directly via fork/pull-request.
For this please note that Google Maps gives the coordinates
in reverse order with respect to GeoJSON. So swap them around
before pasting them to developers.geojson.
